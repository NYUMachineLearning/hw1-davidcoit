This repository contains David Coit's submission for HW #1 of the Fall 2019 Machine Learning class at NYU Sackler.

I copied the .rmd file from the original repository and removed the examples and "further reference" links and saved it as "Coit_David_HW1." Where relevant to the questions, my comments are bolded to be easier to identify.
